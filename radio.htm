<img height="300" src="crowley-lh-1.jpg" width="615">
	<img height="300" src="rigdon-photo-1.jpg" width="341"><br><br>&nbsp;One of 
	cinema's greatest houses, the Lake House was the real star of the 2006 movie of the same name with <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> and <strong>Sandra 
Bullock</strong>.&nbsp; Created with steel and glass in just a few months, the 
	Lake House symbolized the relationship between father and son across 
	generations and between two lovers, Keanu and Sandra, across time. Joining us are the architect and engineer, <strong>Nathan Crowley</strong> and <strong>Fritz Hengge</strong>, 
	who share the story of the birth - and death - of the Lake House.&nbsp; 
	Ready to be swept off your feet?&nbsp;Get ready for celebrated jazz singer and Modernist

<br>Nowhere in the world celebrates Modernism better than Modernism Week in Palm 
Springs, California. Every February, they have a huge architecture and 
design festival and for the last five years, USModernist has been there 
interviewing nearly all Modernism Weekâs keynote speakers plus special 
guests at the USModernist compound, aka poolside at the hip Hotel Skylark.&nbsp;
<br><br>In our second MW show on 
architecture-related movies, <strong>George Smart</strong> talks with three film industry professionals. <strong>Valentina Geneva</strong> is working on a new 
documentary about LA architect <strong>
<a href="http://www.usmodernist.org/schindler.htm"><span class="auto-style32">Rudolph Schindler</span></a></strong>, and later he sits down 
with art director <strong>Jeannine Oppewall,</strong> the genius staging the sets of 
such films as L.A. Confidential (filmed in <strong>
<a href="http://www.usmodernist.org/neutra.htm"><span class="auto-style32">Richard Neutraâs</span></a></strong> Lovell House 
some 26 years ago), plus she worked for eight years for the great husband 
and wife team of <a href="http://www.usmodernist.org/eames.htm">
	<span class="auto-style32">Charles and Ray Eames</span></a>.&nbsp; 
Wrapping up, George visits with <strong>Paula Benson</strong>, travelling to 
Palm Springs from the UK, about the relationship between film and furniture, 
especially as it relates to Modernism.<hr><strong>#153/Modern Miami: Kobi 
Karp<br><br>

<br></strong>Today, we dial into Miami, Florida, home of sun, fun, and some 
of the most over-the-top new Modernism on Earth.&nbsp; In the foodchain of Miami 
culture, a chain which features ceviche, plantains, rum, ropa vieja, and
<strong>Max Strang</strong>, one of the most well-known architects is
<strong>Kobi Karp</strong>, who is not surprisingly CEO of Kobi Karp 
Architecture with many happy clients. His wife must be 
super happy too, because Karp recently got rapper Flo-Ryda to appear for her 
birthday.&nbsp; Later, a few minutes with <strong>Frank Harmon</strong>, reading 
from his book Native Places. <hr><strong>#152/Quiet Mastery: Architect Jim 
Jennings</strong><br><br><img alt="" height="250" src="Jim-Jennings.jpg" width="288"><br><br>

Honor Award for Architecture, was named one of the five most influential and 
inspiring houses of the past decade. He was awarded the 2019 Maybeck Award 
by AIA California, and he teaches at Berkeley. Later on, a few minutes with

Almost all the famous names in the pantheon of mid-century modern 
architecture are, well, male, a function of the widely held but false belief 
there werenât many women interested in architecture, plus the sad but true 
fact that these women were marginalized by the profession, their colleagues, 
and the media. HostGeorge Smartmeets with MW speakers<b> Libby Otto </b>and<b> Jane

critically important developers and builders to the expansion of Modernism. 
While other developers were afraid of Modernist design, as a lot still are

We donât typically think of bridges as

Other than Frank Sinatra, there's are few people who are so tightly woven 
into the spirit of Modernism Week and midcentury culture: 1950's Hollywood 
star <strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong>. Sometime later this year, plans call 
for a nearly 30 foot tall statue of her in the famous blowing white dress to 
return to Palm Springs as a permanent home. In her day, Marilyn was as big 
as any celebrity you could name. She was involved with some of the most 
well-known men in the world: baseball great <strong>Joe Dimaggio</strong>, 
playwright <strong>Arthur Miller</strong>, and generally accepted nowadays,<strong> 
John F. Kennedy</strong>. And she has a connection to a very famous 
architect. Hosts George Smart and Tom Guild talk with three people who keep 
Marilynâs legacy alive for the 21st century. First, itâs <strong>Sunny

<p class="auto-style29"><strong>Craig Ellwood</strong><span class="auto-style18">was 
one of the most exciting people in American architecture. He took Los 
Angeles by storm and no one since has fully captured his personal style or 
his incredible story - but that's on the way.</span>Although 
he took structural engineering courses at UCLA, Ellwood was not a licensed 
architect, but that did not matter to him or to his clients. Ellwood was a 
true design genius. Ellwood could sell, too. He had a red Ferrari 
(among other great cars) and was a perfect fit with the celebrity culture of 
Los Angeles. He was a master of promotion. Derided by the architecture 
profession of which he was formally not a part, he rose to public fame when 
three of his houses were included in the iconic Case Study House series for 
Arts and Architecture Magazine. His houses are still incredibly prized 
today.</p>

<p><span>In a world before the internet, World&rsquo;s Fairs were the killer app of the 19<sup>th</sup> and most of the 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Countries would assemble at a central place for about 6 months and build pavilions, each sharing their nation&rsquo;s technology, culture, and national sources of pride, symbols, heroes, and achievements. If you&rsquo;ve ever been to Epcot at Disney World, you get the layout. There were two World's Fairs in New York. Much of the World&rsquo;s fair architecture was forward-thinking and Modernist, but only a few buildings on the New York fairgrounds survive today, some of them barely. We welcome two superfans who&rsquo;ve been working over ten years to restore what&rsquo;s left, <strong>Mitch Silverstein</strong> and <strong>Stephanie Bohn</strong>, both featured in the documentary Modern Ruin, produced by past podcast guest <strong>Matt Silva</strong>, detailing the site&rsquo;s post-fair use, deterioration, and growing advocacy efforts.</span></p>

Building a coalition of over a dozen nonprofits using social media, modTEXANS have shared thousands of images of midcentury design and architecture that can literally be mapped across the state. </span></p>
<p>When you think of Albuquerque, New Mexico, you might think of southwest adobe design, or maybe that TV show In Plain Sight which filmed there for five years, but you&rsquo;re certainly not thinking of Modernist architecture &ndash; yet.<strong>Thea Haver </strong>is hoping to change that as co-founder and director of Modern Albuquerque.</p>

<p><span><strong>#121/The Incredible TWA Hotel at JFK: Eric Saarinen, Richard Southwick, Anne Marie Lubrano + Lea Ciaverra</strong></span></p>
<p><img height="266" src="saarinen-newTWA.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a building at JFK airport in New York that people have been talking about for almost 60 years. This building had no peer; it was among the most unique in the world, and its creator, <strong>Eero Saarinen</strong>, one of the most visionary architects in the world. For years the airline TWA (later absorbed by American Airlines) used it as a glamorous gateway to the world, sending off passengers in an era people dressed up to fly and there was no such thing as airport security. However, the volume of passengers increased so much that the building had to be abandoned. After a few decades in mothballs, and dangerously close to demolition, Saarinen&rsquo;s TWA terminal has been meticulously restored and expanded, with a world-class hotel adjacent and even better, a massive underground conference facility you&rsquo;d never know was there.</p>
<p>Host <strong>George Smart</strong> was in New York for a huge gala opening inside that underground conference center. He talked with <strong>Richard Southwick</strong>, project partner with restoration architects Beyer Blinder Belle. But first, George sat down in Los Angeles at the iconic Beverly Hilton with Saarinen&rsquo;s son, <strong>Eric Saarinen</strong>. Then George is back in New York with architects <strong>Anne Marie Lubrano</strong> and <strong>Lea Ciaverra</strong>, of the not-surprisingly named firm Lubrano Ciaverra, for the brilliant new TWA hotel, you know, the one with the massive underground conference facility.</p>

<p>Any fan of Modernism has DWELL Magazine somewhere in their house. It&rsquo;s a venerable but relatively recent publication, started in 2000 by <strong>Lara Hedberg Deam</strong> in San Francisco. She&rsquo;s still the owner, and like a winning NFL coach, she&rsquo;s been stocking the team over nearly 20 years with winning players like <strong>Karrie Jacobs, Michela O'Connor Abrams, Amanda Dameron</strong>, and former podcast guest <strong>Alison Arieff</strong>.</p>
<p>With a motto of &ldquo;at home in the Modern World,&rdquo; DWELL helped re-energize a terrazzo (that&rsquo;s our new collective noun) of Modern movements: small houses, modern houses, green houses, sustainable house, micro houses, and prefab houses. Today we go remote with host <strong>George Smart</strong> in New York, where he sits down with <strong>Bill Hanley</strong>, Editor and Chief of DWELL since February 2019.</p>

<p><strong>#118/The Last Frank Lloyd Wright Client: Roland Reisley</strong></p>
<p><img height="250" src="rolandreisley.jpg" width="241" /></p>
<p><strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong>, now 60 years after his death, remains the most well-known architect in America, perhaps the world. Notorious for his ego, which was matched only by his genius and talent, Wright would be delighted to be so this famous for so long. Wright would say, and he did, that he was the greatest architect ever, and for many, he was and still is. <strong>Roland Reisley</strong> was only 26 when he hired Wright for a small house in the 1950's. Now Reisley is Wright's last living client - and still in the same lovely house in upstate New York, a small colony of houses known as Usonia, the prototype for small affordable houses across America in a post-war time when affordable housing was needed.</p>

Here's the plot: near Chicago at the end of the school year, high school senior Ferris Bueller (played by <strong>Matthew Broderick)</strong> fakes being sick to stay home. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeanie (played by <strong>Jennifer Grey</strong>, the baby you don&rsquo;t back into a corner) is not convinced. Ferris persuades his best friend Cameron Frye (played by <strong>Alan Ruck</strong>) to help lure Ferris' girlfriend out of school and let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari. Spoiler: that Ferrari tumbles out of a really cool Modernist house/garage, much to the chagrin of Cameron and his dad. Our pal <strong>Bob Langford</strong>, who pretty much knows every line in the movie, drops by to help examine this cultural icon with guest<strong>Meghann Salamasick</strong>, who with her husband Chris are the owners of the that now-famous Modernist house. Later in the show, with apologies to <strong>Wayne Newton,</strong> it's George and Bob and Tom serenading Meghann.</span></p>

He&rsquo;s probably rather be down at the Groaning Board hoisting a pint than talking to us, but we&rsquo;re thrilled to hear about his new award-winning book, <strong>Making Dystopia:The Strange Rise and Survival of Architectural Barbarism</strong>, in which he takes apart the Modernist movement piece by piece! However, he makes a good argument for how the wider modern movement in the 1950's (highways, cars, planes, not just architecture) has harmed the planet and the community way of life.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Craig Ellwood </strong>was one of the most exciting people in American architecture. He took Los Angeles by storm in the 1950's and no one since has fully captured his personal style or his incredible story on film - but that's on the way.Although he took structural engineering courses at UCLA, Ellwood was not a licensed architect, but that did not matter to him or to his clients. Ellwood was a true design genius. Ellwood could sell, too.He was a perfect fit with the celebrity culture of Los Angeles. His houses are still incredibly prized today.From poolside at the swanky Hotel Skylark, Host George Smart interviews Ellwood&rsquo;s daughter, Erin Ellwood; his partner, architect Jim Tyler; director Maria Demopoulos who&rsquo;s working on a new feature film about Ellwood, and expert Ellwood restorer Barton Jahncke, who has brought more than one ailing Ellwood house gloriously back to life.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>#88/My Grandfather, Mies: Dirk Lohan</span><br /><br /><span><img alt="https://www-gradycampbell-com-files.s3.amazonaws.com/52d2-0364401-dirk_large.jpg?versionId=kSqt3RxsQmkPxr_QiioupWb1gYsGlmpl" height="200" src="lohan-photo-1.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_1" width="160" /></span></strong></p>
<p>Most people refer to architect <strong>Mies van der Rohe</strong> as Mies, which puts him into that rare club of people known by their first names, like <strong> Cher</strong> or <strong>Sting</strong> or <strong>Wynonna</strong>. Born in Germany, Mies was into totally architect <strong>Adolf Loos</strong> -- who famously declared that ornament is a crime and pursued unadorned Modernist design to represent the new era of technology and production. Mies got worldwide attention with two projects, the Barcelona Pavilion and the Villa Tugenhat. He joined the avant-garde Bauhaus school as director of architecture and left Germany in 1937 to head up the architecture school at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. He designed many buildings on that campus including Crown Hall for the School of Architecture. Along with<strong>Gropius</strong> and<strong>Lecorbusier</strong>, Mies is widely regarded as one of the masters of Modernist architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Dirk Lohan</strong>, grandson of Mies, and no relation to Lindsay, wasbornnear Berlin in 1938 and left Germany to study with his grandfather at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Later, he worked with Mies designing projects as the New National Gallery in Berlin, the IBM office building in Chicago and The Toronto Dominion Centre. He's known for the renovated Soldier Field, the original McDonald's campus (where he witnessed the first McNuggets), and many other buildings.</p>

<p><strong><span>#87/Frank Lloyd Wright's David Wright House in Phoenix: Victor Sidy + Alison King</span><br /><br /><span><img alt="Vic-Sidy" border="0" height="250" src="sidy-photo.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_2" width="173" /><img alt="alison king phoenix" height="250" src="alisonking-photo.jpg" width="250" /></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Architect <strong>Victor Sidy</strong> was Dean of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture at Taliesin with campuses in Scottsdale, Arizona and Spring Green, Wisconsin. He was a vocal advocate for saving Frank Lloyd Wright houses and buildings and for walkable community development. In 2015 he returned to private practice but is still involved with one special Frank Lloyd Wright house in Phoenix, the David and Gladys Wright House, which father Frank designed for his son. <o:p>The house has been on a rollercoaster in recent years, doomed one moment, saved the next, in limbo the next.</o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Historian <strong>Alison King</strong> is founder of Modern Phoenix and is Associate Professor of Design at The Art Institute of Phoenix. Since 2003 she has published Arizona's largest website for midcentury architecture, ModernPhoenix.net, and she hosts an annual home tour and the always interesting Modern Phoenix Week. Alison gave USModernist a wonderful tour last November of both residential and commercial modernist buildings, culminating in a trip to the David and Gladys Wright House. </span></p>
<p><span>Host <strong>George Smart</strong> interviewed Victor and Alison in the lobby of the Embassy Suites Hotel right off Central Avenue, just a few blocks up from <strong>Will Bruder&rsquo;s</strong> Burton Barr Phoenix Central Library. </span></p>

<p><strong>#86/Phoenix Modern: Will Bruder</strong></p>
<p><span><img alt="" height="250" src="bruder-photo.jpg" width="250" /></span></p>
<p><span>USModernist took 25 fans of the podcast to tour Phoenix, Arizona last November. Phoenix is the home of the Chimichanga, which Tucson disputes, but more importantly, the city is home to some really great Modernist architecture. USModernist saw the Musical Instrument Museum, <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s</strong> Taliesin West, <strong>Paulo Soleri&rsquo;s</strong> Cosanti and Arcosanti, Wright&rsquo;s First Christian Church, and the David and Gladys Wright House, among many other amazing buildings.</span></p>
<p><span>One outstanding place USModernist visited was the Phoenix Central Library, designed by Arizona&rsquo;s <strong>Will Bruder.</strong> Largely self-trained, Bruder apprenticed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Soleri"> 
<span class="auto-style32">Paolo Soleri</span></a> in woodwork, metal work, and masonry and contributed to Soleri's bookArcology. After graduating from college in 1969, Bruder apprenticed with<strong>Gunnar Birkerts</strong>, assisting in design of theContemporary Arts Museum in Houston. He opened his first studio in 1974 and in 1987 was a fellow at theAmerican Academy in Rome.Host <strong>George Smart</strong> interviewed <strong>Will Bruder</strong> in the lobby of the Embassy Suites right off Central Avenue, just a few blocks up from his Phoenix Central Library.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>#85/Cape Cod Modern: Peter McMahon</span><br /><br /><img alt="peter mcmahon cape cod" src="mcmahon-photo.jpg" /><br /><br /></strong><span>Ah, Cape Cod, the arm-shaped stretch of Massachusetts where Boston goes in the summer. The sun. The ocean.The traffic.The clam chowder. The summer theatre productions. And best of all, except for perhaps the clam chowder, the Modernist architecture by </span><strong><span><a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/breuer.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Marcel Breuer</span></a>, <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/gropius.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Walter Gropius</span></a></span></strong><span>, and others. There are more than 100 modernist houses representing a little-known treasure map of residential architecture. Guest <strong>Peter McMahon</strong> is Principal of PM Design. Peter&rsquo;s Olympic moment for preservation came in 2006, when he curated an exhibition on Cape Cod modernist architecture for the Provincetown Art Museum. This led to the creation of the unique and I must say highly effective Cape Cod Modern House Trust, which documents and preserves these houses and makes them available for the public to stay in. His own summer house in Wellfleet MA was published inHouse BeautifulandOutside and he is co-author with <strong>Christine Cipriani</strong> ofCape Cod Modern: Mid-Century Architecture and Community on the Outer Cape.</span></p>

<span>In 1948, no architect was more famous, admired, or despised than the Modernist <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong>. He polarized America with a combination of brilliance and arrogance. Most US universities were very slow to embrace the growing Modernist movement &ndash; until NC State University in Raleigh North Carolina stepped up its game. In the fall of 1948, one new Dean brought the bright promise of Modernism. He stayed Dean for 25 years, and although he died in 1990, his impact on thousands of careers and tens of thousands of buildings lives on. Today USModernist Radio welcomes his former students, old friends, and respected colleagues <strong>Abie Harris, Roger Clark, Ben Taylor, and Jerzy GÅ&oacute;wczewski</strong> to talk about the man, the myth, the legend, <strong>Henry Kamphoefner.</strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong>#43/Icons East and West: Fallingwater's Denise Miner and Shari Stahl Grunwald of the Stahl House</strong></span><br /><br /><img src="wright251.jpg" width="225" height="200" /><img src="koenig3.jpg" width="163" height="200" /></p>
<p>There are certain Modernist houses that just can&rsquo;t be captured in a photo, a video, or even a 3D rendering. For example, Fallingwater in Pennsylvania is considered to be <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s</strong> greatest residential work. It continues to attract millions of people, and in 1991 the AIA named Fallingwater the "best all-t ime work of American architecture.<strong>"Denise Miner</strong> is Public Tour Supervisor at Fallingwater. She&rsquo;s been associated with the house in some way almost all her life and has worked there as a guide for more than 30 years. Her grandfather and two uncles were part of Fallingwater&rsquo;s construction and she is the Obiwan Kenobi of Fallingwater, training their team of wonderful guides.</p>
<p>However, there ain&rsquo;t no party like a west coast party, and in LA there&rsquo;s a house that&rsquo;s not only iconic, it&rsquo;s a true Hollywood movie celebrity. Former football player <strong>Buck Stahl</strong> created the vision for the Stahl House, also known as Case Study House 22, designed by <strong>Pierre Koenig.</strong> The two-bedroom house features a wraparound view from the mountains to the sea. It starred in countless movies and TV plusmusic videos forATB and <strong>Wilson Phillips</strong>. In 2013 it was listed on theNational Register of Historic Places. <strong>Shari Stahl Grunwald</strong> grew up in the home and administers the property with her brother Bruce.</p>

<p><span><strong>#42/Death of a Master Plan: Erin Sterling Lewis + Lewis Clarke</strong></span></p>
<p>After WWII, states looked at their aging capitol buildings and considered sweeping new plans to bring technology, commerce, government, and even the performing arts into the full 20th century. One of the few state capitols to actually achieve this was Albany NY. Albany&rsquo;s master plan was so successful, North Carolina wanted to do the same thing. The goal was, like Albany, to transform the epicenter of downtown Raleigh, the state capitol, into a city of the future. The blue ribbon panel of architects, consultants, and government members presented a beautiful plan.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Sterling Lewis</strong> is a partner in situ studio in Raleigh. She is past President of AIA North Carolina representing the thousands of architects in the state. One of those consultants from 1965 is <strong>Lewis Clarke, </strong>North Carolina&rsquo;s most prolific landscape architect.</p>

<p><strong><img src="schind3.gif" width="200" height="217" /></strong></p>
<p>Rudolph Michael Schindler, who went by Michael, was one of the most important Modernist architects of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, yet he is largely unknown to the public outside California.<strong> Frank Lloyd Wright</strong> hired him in 1918, and soon he was running Wright's studio in Oak Park the later in Los Angeles. Schindler and Wright argued frequently and eventually Schindler quit, becoming a huge success on his own. Schindler and his wife Pauline were dead center in the Los Angeles creative scene, hanging out with the era's celebrities in art, sculpture, design, and dance.</p>
<p>We talk with daughter-in-law <strong>Dr. Mary Schindler</strong>,perhaps one of the last living people who knew Michael Schindler, who died in 1953. She was married to his son Mark at the time and lived in their famous King&rsquo;s Road house with Mark, Michael, and Pauline. We also talk with musician <strong>Guillaume Schindler</strong>, Schindler's great-grandson, who is a docent at the King's Road house.

We talk with <strong>Thomas Bena</strong> and <strong>Mollie Doyle</strong>, stars and creators of the new documentary <em>One Big Home,</em> based in Martha's Vineyard MA. Like many wealthy coastal communities, 10,000 sf and 20,000 sf and even larger McMansions started appearing during the 1990&rsquo;s. One Big Home is about Thomas Bena's work to curb the disruption of life on the island by giant houses. But the film is more than the story of a cause. Along the way, he found a girlfriend, Mollie Doyle, they married, moved, had a beautiful daughter named Emma - all events that influenced or changed his progress and perspective on the film and his life.</p>

<p><strong>#32/ModMonuments: Joshua David + Matthew Silva</strong></p>
<p>One of the problems with preserving futuristic-looking Modernist buildings is that they just don&rsquo;t look that old. They aren&rsquo;t universally loved, in fact some of them weren&rsquo;t that popular when they were built. The World Monuments Fund (WMF) is a private nonprofit organization to decelerate the destruction of important artistic treasures throughout the world. You might have heard of the Leaning Tower of Pisa? They helped fix it. Well, they helped stop the extra leaning.</p>

<div><strong><span>#25/HouseTrackers: Jan-Richard Kikkert + Paul Moore</span><br /><br /></strong><span>A lot of Modernist houses you love from the 1950's and 1960's are going the way of unfortunate "renovations" or worse yet the bulldozer, largely because few people are aware of their architectural significance. Although most houses by famous architects are on project lists, it's difficult to find where they are actually located. We talk with two expert house trackers who have between them documented thousands of houses and flown tens of thousands of miles to visit them.</span><strong><br /><br /><img src="kikkert-photo.jpg" width="200" height="200" /><img src="pmoore-photo.jpg" width="200" height="200" /><br /><br /><span>Jan-Richard Kikkert</span></strong><span> is a Dutch architect based in Amsterdam and is head of the Architectural Department of the Amsterdam Academy of Architecture.

<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen a thriller like North By Northwest or Diamonds are Forever (or many others since) you may have noticed that the bad guy has impeccable taste. The classic villain has custom-tailored suits (or dresses, let&rsquo;s not be sexist), a high-end car you can&rsquo;t even buy used at Carmax, a British or vaguely Russian accent, and a gorgeous Modernist house, preferably with a killer view as certainly there will be some killing going on.</p>

<p><img src="sydney.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="200" height="109" /><br /><span>In 1957, architect <strong>Jorn Utzon</strong> unexpectedly won the commission for the iconic Sydney Opera House. His submission was one of 233 designs from 32 countries, many of them from the most famous architects in the world. Juror Eero Saarinen described the design as genius and could not endorse any other choice. Yet the project was rife with politics, cost overruns, incompetent cost estimators in the Australian government, and decades of wrangling. Utzon was eventually fired through no fault of his own. The Opera House was finally completed and opened in 1973. Utzon was rehired in 1999 to develop a master plan and bring closure to a long-running drama.</span></p>

<div>
<p><img src="kosmerick-photo.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Todd Kosmerick</strong> is University Archivist for NC State University's Archives. He and his staff collect, preserve, and make accessible vast physical and online resources that document the growth and development of the university and its continued service to the people of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Designed by <a href="https://www.ncmodernist.org/waugh.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Terry Waugh</span></a>, Harrelson Hall was the first round classroom structure ever built on a university campus. With a huge 206 foot diameter and a long winding ramp to the top floor, staff and faculty offices were located on the rim, while lecture rooms are along the inner part of the building. While folks generally admired the design concept, the building was generally hated as an academic building. The weird-shaped, windowless classrooms, the wacky and rarely working HVAC, the too-easy temptation of skateboarders, bicyclists, and remote controlled cars careening down the pedestrian ramp four floors, and for a while the complete lack of an elevator - all contributed. After a long period of service, abandonment, and use as temporary offices as newer buildings were built, it has been destroyed.</p>

<span class="auto-style32">Richard Neutra</span></a> and <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/wright.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></a>, yet his quieter career work stands as some of the most brilliant of the 20th century. Practicing primarily in California, Texas, and North Carolina, his achievements in residential, commercial, and academic settings earned national admiration and awards including the Richard Neutra Medal and an honorary doctorate from North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Architect <strong>Frank Harmon</strong> was Harwell's student, close friend, and executor of his estate. Harmon was educated in North Carolina State University&rsquo;s School of Design and at the Architectural Association in London. Harmon has received over 40 design awards, including the 2013 F. Carter Williams Gold Medal. Harmon announced his retirement in November 2015. Architect Jeffrey Lee writes: &ldquo;Across the architectural profession, Frank Harmon is the face of North Carolina architecture.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Author <strong>Lisa Germany Ziegler</strong> has written on architecture since the early 1980&rsquo;s, contributing to publications such as Architectural Record, Harvard Design Magazine, and Progressive Architecture. Her beautiful and detailed 1991 book on Harris traced the development of his life, career, and honored place in American modernism. Her most recent book is Houses of the Sundown Sea: The Architectural Vision of Harry Gesner.</p>

If you didn't know otherwise, you'd be sure it was a Frank Lloyd Wright design. And you'd be close. It was designed by his son-in-law, William Wesley Peters. The place has been immaculately maintained and restored by a loving couple who are looking to downsize. You'll hear from those owners, their realtor Aaron Weber, and the challenges of selling one of the state's architecture masterpieces at 4212 CO Road JJ, Black Earth, WI. </span></p>

<p><strong>Aidan Buehler</strong> was 15 years old in 2015. "Basically, I designed a house from start to finish,&rdquo; he said, although it ended up being larger than planned. He laid out rooms and external design features, furnished the house, and added paint and textures. He did not include a plumbing system, electrical system, or internal wiring. &ldquo;I did put in some vents and designed it so that, with some editing, it could be built legally I should hope,&rdquo; he said. He got some of his ideas from architecture books he read. &ldquo;For the most part, however, it was me experimenting with random ideas of mine and seeing if they looked good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Although I did go into this project with ideas as to what qualities I wanted in my house, my model was constantly changing.&rdquo; He estimates that he spent several hundred hours on the project.</p>

<p><strong>Jerry Nowell</strong> ran North Carolina&rsquo;s first all-contemporary furniture store, names, not surprisingly, Nowell&rsquo;s Contemporary Furniture. He was the third generation of Nowell since 1905 to bring exciting designs like the Eames chair and many other iconic furnishings to the state.In 1968, Nowell's became the first all contemporary furniture store in North Carolina. It was also among the first furniture stores to challenge the &ldquo;blue laws&rdquo; prohibiting sales on Sunday and likely the first to hire black salespeople. Jerry closed the store a few years ago to spend more time with his family. The 20,000 sf store is greatly missed as a regional destination for Modernist house owners.

<span class="auto-style32">Paul Rudolph</span></a> was not as well-known as <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/wright.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></a> but he designed equally fascinating and creative Modernist buildings. While inspiring a generation of architects, the public generally did not warm to his large brutalist designs, finding the intense use of concrete and steel to be ugly or oppressive. But hey, we love 'em, and today we welcome two passionate and willing-to-do-something-about-it architects who fight for Paul Rudolph&rsquo;s brilliant buildings from different parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><img src="kaufman-photo-1.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="113" height="153" /></p>
<p><strong>Gene Kaufman</strong> has designed over $1B worth of hotels in New York City. In 2011, his firm Gene Kaufman Architect 
bought the esteemed Modernist architecture firm <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/gwathmey.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Gwathmey Siegel</span></a>; the result is Gwathmey Siegel Kaufman &amp; Associates Architects.</p>

<p><strong>Joe King</strong> is an architect and contractor practicing in Bradenton FL. With <strong>Christopher Domin</strong>, he is co-author of the essential book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paul-Rudolph-The-Florida-Houses/dp/1568985517">

<p>Ever since Modernist houses hit the mainstream in the 1950&rsquo;s, the real estate community has largely stayed away. That continues. Unaware of their rich history, contemptuous of their design style, and overreacting to certain flaws, realtors often scare buyers off, causing in part more than a few demolitions. Two Modernist Realtors keep it real about these wonderful "livable works of art."</p>

<p><span><strong>John Morris</strong> is a usability engineer by day but by night he's the Batman of downtown architecture, documenting and photographing buildings in Chicago and Raleigh. He's also a superfan of Modernist architect Milton Small Jr., student of <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/vanderrohe.htm">
<span class="auto-style32">Mies Van der Rohe.</span></a> Although Small died in 1992, his firm lived on through Small&rsquo;s son <strong>Milton Small III</strong> of Small Kane Architects. We'll talk with John and Milton about the man they both admire. Frank relives his Modernist childhood! A water heater over the sink, oh my! Mt. Olive University!

<p><strong>#3/Drawing: Mike Welton + Jim Cutler</strong></p>
<p><img src="welton-photo.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="134" height="200" border="0" /> <img src="cutler-photo.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="146" height="200" border="0" /></p>
<p>Author <strong>J. Michael Welton</strong> writes about architecture, art, and design for national and regional publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, Dwell, and Architectural Record. His new book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Practice-Architects-Meaning-Freehand/dp/0415725097">
<span class="auto-style32">Drawing from Practice: Architects and the Meaning of Freehand.</span></a></p>
<p>One of the architects featured in the book is <strong>Jim Cutler,</strong> Seattle-area architect well-known for his work in sustainability. He also designed a little $66M million cottage for Microsoft's Bill and Melinda Gates in the 1990's (with Peter Bohlin).</p>
<p>Cutler is a passionate advocate for the return of freehand drawing in university architecture programs. His theory on how drawing affects thinking has huge implications for creativity in architecture. It's called the externalization of cognition, or in other words, the force behind, among other things, why we often move our hands as we're talking.</p>
<p>What's the Ferrari of drawing pencils! Does Bill Gates keep his high-tech house current with Windows Update? Does CAD make architects dumber? Or does drawing make them smarter? Who will start a Kickstarter campaign for the externalization of cognition? The first Microsoft iPad!</p>

<p>Here's the quote none of us could think of that's engraved on the ceiling of<strong> Bill Gates'</strong> personal library: &ldquo;He had come such a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close he could hardly fail to grasp it." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

<p><strong>#2/Cyclorama: Christine Madrid French</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="french-photo-1.jpg" alt="USModernist" width="200" height="198" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chris French</strong> is one of America&rsquo;s foremost experts on Modernist preservation. She is co-founder of the Recent Past Preservation Network (the first Modernist preservation organization) and served as President for nine years. She pretty much knows everything Modern from Bauhaus to Bob's Big Boy. We'll hear about her brave, decade-long attempt to save Richard Neutra's Cyclorama at Gettysburg PA.</p>

<p>Although actress<strong> Kelly Lynch</strong> appeared in Drugstore Cowboy, Roadhouse, Charlie&rsquo;s Angels, and the swanky Miami TV series Magic City, we love her three movies about Modernist preservation, Visual Acoustics: The Modernism Of Julius Shulman, Infinite Space: The Architecture Of John Lautner, and The Oyler House: Richard Neutra&rsquo;s Desert Retreat. She's also got two killer Modernist houses in California, one by <a href="https://www.usmodernist.org/neutra.htm">
